Changelist:
Importing Google Spreadsheet Data
    - User can now import large amounts of vocab words using google spreadsheets.
    - This allows users to share their vocab lists.
    - Importing from Google Spreadsheets overrides the WaniKani vocab.
    - If an update to the spreadsheet occurs, they just have to click the "import" button again.
    - Shows the total number of entries that have been imported. Which could be multiple synonyms.
Custom Vocab Override
    - User can now override WaniKani vocab entries AND "Google spreadsheets import" using the custom vocab box.
    - Or if they just want to add a few extra vocab words easily, they can also use it for that too.
    - This is meant as a quick and dirty way to add your own custom vocab easily without setting up a google spreadsheet.
    - For example, "time" gets translated as "〜回" from WaniKani, which is silly. So you can use this to override it to just "回" if you want.
Google Chrome Sync
    - Settings for wanikanify now are persistence across computers if user has Chrome's sync functionality enabled.
    - Note the vocab data is not synced because it's too much data. But the settings are synced, so you'll just have to click the "import" buttons again for Google Spreadsheets.
    - The custom vocab box will be synced, unless there's too much data in it. The sync could fail if there's too much data in the Custom Vocab text box.
Audio
    - Mousing over a word will play the audio for that word from JP101 or GoogleTTS.
    - Audio is delayed slightly so it's not annoying and doesn't cause unnecessary server load.
    - This works very well as a learning tool with rikaikun.
    - It's possible the audio played could not be correct if the readings are missing from the spreadsheets.
        - Without the readings, it has to default to using GoogleTTS.
    - If the audio doesn't work, you may need to type in a captcha here: http://translate.google.com/translate_tts?ie=UTF-8&q=ねこ&tl=ja

TODO:
Audio
    - Put in option to disable the audio functionality.
    - All audio should come from wanikani if it's a wanikani word, and then google.
    - Give users of audio the ability to change it from japanese to some other language.
    - Change custom vocab to include "readings"

Change everything over to use chrome sync.

Verify all messaging makes sense and that it's user friendly.
Had some issues with race conditions and saving/loading and importing of data.
    - Check all importing and saving/loading to make sure there aren't any race conditions.
Run tests where I've imported about 6000 vocab words.

Remove the "allImportedVocabDictionaries" variable. This isn't really needed, since the other page needs to fetch it from chrome cache anyways.

Convert all for loops into jquery loops.
Upgrade JQuery to remove warning about synchronous xmlhttprequest call being deprecated.

Can't fix.
User can not specify the columns by number and can not choose to have a header. Tabletop requires it.
